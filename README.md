## An app created as a team at the Court Hack hack-a-thon

- uses AVAudio tools to record voice in small files for translation by a court translator
- differentiates between voice and silence/voice and needless noise(papers rustling, coughs, etc.)
- saves in short intevals as separate files so the interpreter can quickly translate for the defense/prosecution
